## Description
This project was an introduction to my own private study of Machine Learning (ML) outside of education. <br>
Conway's Game of Life (CGOL) is an interesting piece of cellular automota and I wanted to put my own spin on it. <br>
This will generate as many rule states as defined in "config.ini" and train a model on this dataset.
